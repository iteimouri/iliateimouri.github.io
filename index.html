I possess a <a href="https://inspirehep.net/literature/1706131">Doctorate in Theoretical Physics</a>, focusing on String Theory and Modified Theories of Gravity. Specifically, I have extensively researched various aspects of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_derivative_gravity">Infinite Derivative Theory of Gravity</a>. <br>After completing my PhD, I accepted a postdoctoral fellowship at the <a href="https://www.bcg.com">Boston Consulting Group</a> (BCG) and the <a href="https://lims.ac.uk/ilia-teimouri/">London Institute for Mathematical Sciences</a>, where I focused on the mathematical structure of innovation. Subsequently, I served as a Scientific Consultant for BCG, guiding their <a href="https://www.bcg.com/beyond-consulting/bcg-gamma/demand-forecasting">COVID Pandemic Modelling Program</a>. I then transitioned to a Data Science Fellowship at <a href="https://faculty.ai/">Faculty</a>, followed by a role as a Data Scientist at <a href="https://www.iqvia.com/">IQVIA</a>. Currently, I am a Senior Data Scientist at <a href="https://www.ubs.com/">UBS</a>, providing cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence solutions and products to various divisions of the bank. <br>In addition to my corporate pursuits, I am also a Co-Founder of the <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nvesto-stock-exchange">Nvesto Stock Exchange</a>.
